# Inventory-Management-System
A Python-based inventory management system that efficiently handles item records, updates stock levels based on transactions, and generates and saves purchase bills using file handling techniques.

A simple Python-based inventory management system that handles the following functionalities:

- Load Inventory: Reads and displays item records from a text file containing descriptions of all available inventory items.
- Update Inventory: Adjusts stock levels based on customer purchases by modifying the inventory data accordingly.
- Generate Bills: Creates a bill for each transaction and saves it to a text file for record-keeping.
- Save Changes: Updates the inventory text file to reflect the latest stock after purchases.

This project demonstrates basic file handling and data processing in Python to manage inventory operations effectively.
